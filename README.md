# gen_mycoast
A package to generate my own coastline for map plotting. For example, paleo-coastline.


For Matlab use, written with Matlab R2019b full license. Might not work with some old version or limited license, also may not work with some m_map projections (still testing).


For Python use, may need numpy, Basemap/Cartopy, shapely, shapefile, matplotlib packages. May not work with some Basemap projections, and is still testing with Cartopy (not working well).
